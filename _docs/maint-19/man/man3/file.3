.SH NAME
file \- File interface module.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides an interface to the file system\&.
.LP
On operating systems with thread support, file operations can be performed in threads of their own, allowing other Erlang processes to continue executing in parallel with the file operations\&. See command-line flag \fI+A\fR\& in \fB\fIerl(1)\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.LP
Regarding filename encoding, the Erlang VM can operate in two modes\&. The current mode can be queried using function \fB\fInative_name_encoding/0\fR\&\fR\&\&. It returns \fIlatin1\fR\& or \fIutf8\fR\&\&.
.LP
In \fIlatin1\fR\& mode, the Erlang VM does not change the encoding of filenames\&. In \fIutf8\fR\& mode, filenames can contain Unicode characters greater than 255 and the VM converts filenames back and forth to the native filename encoding (usually UTF-8, but UTF-16 on Windows)\&.
.LP
The default mode depends on the operating system\&. Windows and MacOS X enforce consistent filename encoding and therefore the VM uses \fIutf8\fR\& mode\&.
.LP
On operating systems with transparent naming (for example, all Unix systems except MacOS X), default is \fIutf8\fR\& if the terminal supports UTF-8, otherwise \fIlatin1\fR\&\&. The default can be overridden using \fI+fnl\fR\& (to force \fIlatin1\fR\& mode) or \fI+fnu\fR\& (to force \fIutf8\fR\& mode) when starting \fB\fIerts:erl\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.LP
On operating systems with transparent naming, files can be inconsistently named, for example, some files are encoded in UTF-8 while others are encoded in ISO Latin-1\&. The concept of \fIraw filenames\fR\& is introduced to handle file systems with inconsistent naming when running in \fIutf8\fR\& mode\&.
.LP
A \fIraw filename\fR\& is a filename specified as a binary\&. The Erlang VM does not translate a filename specified as a binary on systems with transparent naming\&.
.LP
When running in \fIutf8\fR\& mode, functions \fB\fIlist_dir/1\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIread_link/1\fR\&\fR\& never return raw filenames\&. To return all filenames including raw filenames, use functions \fB\fIlist_dir_all/1\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIread_link_all/1\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.LP
See also section \fBNotes About Raw Filenames\fR\& in the STDLIB User\&'s Guide\&.

.LP
This function only succeeds in platforms that provide this feature\&. When it succeeds, space is preallocated for the file but the file size might not be updated\&. This behaviour depends on the preallocation implementation\&. To guarantee that the file size is updated, truncate the file to the new size\&.

Copies \fIByteCount\fR\& bytes from \fISource\fR\& to \fIDestination\fR\&\&. \fISource\fR\& and \fIDestination\fR\& refer to either filenames or IO devices from, for example, \fIopen/2\fR\&\&. \fIByteCount\fR\& defaults to \fIinfinity\fR\&, denoting an infinite number of bytes\&.
.LP
Argument \fIModes\fR\& is a list of possible modes, see \fB\fIopen/2\fR\&\fR\&, and defaults to \fI[]\fR\&\&.
.LP
If both \fISource\fR\& and \fIDestination\fR\& refer to filenames, the files are opened with \fI[read, binary]\fR\& and \fI[write, binary]\fR\& prepended to their mode lists, respectively, to optimize the copy\&.
.LP
If \fISource\fR\& refers to a filename, it is opened with \fIread\fR\& mode prepended to the mode list before the copy, and closed when done\&.
.LP
If \fIDestination\fR\& refers to a filename, it is opened with \fIwrite\fR\& mode prepended to the mode list before the copy, and closed when done\&.
.LP
Returns \fI{ok, BytesCopied}\fR\&, where \fIBytesCopied\fR\& is the number of bytes that was copied, which can be less than \fIByteCount\fR\& if end of file was encountered on the source\&. If the operation fails, \fI{error, Reason}\fR\& is returned\&.

Ensures that any buffers kept by the operating system (not by the Erlang runtime system) are written to disk\&. In many ways it resembles \fIfsync\fR\& but it does not update some of the metadata of the file, such as the access time\&. On some platforms this function has no effect\&.
.LP
Applications that access databases or log files often write a tiny data fragment (for example, one line in a log file) and then call \fIfsync()\fR\& immediately to ensure that the written data is physically stored on the hard disk\&. Unfortunately, \fIfsync()\fR\& always initiates two write operations: one for the newly written data and another one to update the modification time stored in the \fIinode\fR\&\&. If the modification time is not a part of the transaction concept, \fIfdatasync()\fR\& can be used to avoid unnecessary \fIinode\fR\& disk write operations\&.
.LP
Available only in some POSIX systems, this call results in a call to \fIfsync()\fR\&, or has no effect in systems not providing the \fIfdatasync()\fR\& syscall\&.

The purpose of this option is to increase performance by reducing the number of operating system calls\&. Thus, the \fIwrite/2\fR\& calls must be for sizes significantly less than \fISize\fR\&, and not interspersed by too many other file operations\&.

Depending on the encoding, different methods of reading and writing data is preferred\&. The default encoding of \fIlatin1\fR\& implies using this module (\fIfile\fR\&) for reading and writing data as the interfaces provided here work with byte-oriented data\&. Using other (Unicode) encodings makes the \fB\fIio(3)\fR\&\fR\& functions \fIget_chars\fR\&, \fIget_line\fR\&, and \fIput_chars\fR\& more suitable, as they can work with the full Unicode range\&.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"

.LP
Some operating system file operations, for example, a \fIsync/1\fR\& or \fIclose/1\fR\& on a huge file, can block their calling thread for seconds\&. If this affects the emulator main thread, the response time is no longer in the order of milliseconds, depending on the definition of "soft" in soft real-time system\&.
.LP
If the device driver thread pool is active, file operations are done through those threads instead, so the emulator can go on executing Erlang processes\&. Unfortunately, the time for serving a file operation increases because of the extra scheduling required from the operating system\&.
.LP
If the device driver thread pool is disabled or of size 0, large file reads and writes are segmented into many smaller, which enable the emulator to serve other processes during the file operation\&. This has the same effect as when using the thread pool, but with larger overhead\&. Other file operations, for example, \fIsync/1\fR\& or \fIclose/1\fR\& on a huge file, still are a problem\&.
.LP
For increased performance, raw files are recommended\&. Raw files use the file system of the host machine of the node\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
For normal files (non-raw), the file server is used to find the files, and if the node is running its file server as slave to the file server of another node, and the other node runs on some other host machine, they can have different file systems\&. However, this is seldom a problem\&.

.LP
A normal file is really a process so it can be used as an I/O device (see \fB\fIio\fR\&\fR\&)\&. Therefore, when data is written to a normal file, the sending of the data to the file process, copies all data that are not binaries\&. Opening the file in binary mode and writing binaries is therefore recommended\&. If the file is opened on another node, or if the file server runs as slave to the file server of another node, also binaries are copied\&.
.LP
Caching data to reduce the number of file operations, or rather the number of calls to the file driver, generally increases performance\&. The following function writes 4 MBytes in 23 seconds when tested:
.LP
.nf

create_file_slow(Name, N) when integer(N), N >= 0 ->
    {ok, FD} = file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    ok = create_file_slow(FD, 0, N),
    ok = ?FILE_MODULE:close(FD),
    ok.
      
create_file_slow(FD, M, M) ->

create_file_slow(FD, M, N) ->

In the current implementation, binaries larger than 64 bytes are stored in memory common to all processes and not copied when sent between processes, while these smaller binaries are stored on the process heap and copied when sent like any other term\&.
.LP
So, with a binary size of 68 bytes, \fIcreate_file/2\fR\& runs 30 percent slower than with 64 bytes, and causes much more memory fragmentation\&. Notice that if the binaries were to be sent between processes (for example, a non-raw file), the results would probably be completely different\&.

A raw file is really a port\&. When writing data to a port, it is efficient to write a list of binaries\&. It is not needed to flatten a deep list before writing\&. On Unix hosts, scatter output, which writes a set of buffers in one operation, is used when possible\&. In this way \fIwrite(FD, [Bin1, Bin2 | Bin3])\fR\& writes the contents of the binaries without copying the data at all, except for perhaps deep down in the operating system kernel\&.
.LP
For raw files, \fIpwrite/2\fR\& and \fIpread/2\fR\& are efficiently implemented\&. The file driver is called only once for the whole operation, and the list iteration is done in the file driver\&.
.LP
The options \fIdelayed_write\fR\& and \fIread_ahead\fR\& to \fB\fIopen/2\fR\&\fR\& make the file driver cache data to reduce the number of operating system calls\&. The function \fIcreate_file/2\fR\& in the recent example takes 60 seconds without option \fIdelayed_write\fR\&, which is 2\&.6 times slower\&.
.LP
As a bad example, \fIcreate_file_slow/2\fR\& without options \fIraw\fR\&, \fIbinary\fR\&, and \fIdelayed_write\fR\&, meaning it calls \fIopen(Name, [write])\fR\&, needs 1 min 20 seconds for the job, which is 3\&.5 times slower than the first example, and 150 times slower than the optimized \fIcreate_file/2\fR\&\&.

Warning:
.RE
If an error occurs when accessing an open file with module \fB\fIio\fR\&\fR\&, the process handling the file exits\&. The dead file process can hang if a process tries to access it later\&. This will be fixed in a future release\&.
