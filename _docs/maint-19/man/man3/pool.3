.TH pool 3 "stdlib 3.3" "Ericsson AB" "Erlang Module Definition"
.SH NAME
pool \- Load distribution facility.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module can be used to run a set of Erlang nodes as a pool of computational processors\&. It is organized as a master and a set of slave nodes and includes the following features:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
The slave nodes send regular reports to the master about their current load\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Queries can be sent to the master to determine which node will have the least load\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
The BIF \fIstatistics(run_queue)\fR\& is used for estimating future loads\&. It returns the length of the queue of ready to run processes in the Erlang runtime system\&.
.LP
The slave nodes are started with the \fB\fIslave(3)\fR\&\fR\& module\&. This effects terminal I/O, file I/O, and code loading\&.
.LP
If the master node fails, the entire pool exits\&.

.LP
Starts a new pool\&. The file \fI\&.hosts\&.erlang\fR\& is read to find host names where the pool nodes can be started; see section \fBFiles\fR\&\&. The startup procedure fails if the file is not found\&.
.LP
The slave nodes are started with \fB\fIslave:start/2,3\fR\&\fR\&, passing along \fIName\fR\& and, if provided, \fIArgs\fR\&\&. \fIName\fR\& is used as the first part of the node names, \fIArgs\fR\& is used to specify command-line arguments\&.
.LP
Access rights must be set so that all nodes in the pool have the authority to access each other\&.
.LP
The function is synchronous and all the nodes, and all the system servers, are running when it returns a value\&.

.SH "FILES"

.LP
\fI\&.hosts\&.erlang\fR\& is used to pick hosts where nodes can be started\&. For information about format and location of this file, see \fB\fInet_adm:host_file/0\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.LP
\fI$HOME/\&.erlang\&.slave\&.out\&.HOST\fR\& is used for all extra I/O that can come from the slave nodes on standard I/O\&. If the startup procedure does not work, this file can indicate the reason\&.
