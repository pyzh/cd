.SH NAME
digraph_utils \- Algorithms for directed graphs.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides algorithms based on depth-first traversal of directed graphs\&. For basic functions on directed graphs, see the \fB\fIdigraph(3)\fR\&\fR\& module\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
A \fIdirected graph\fR\& (or just "digraph") is a pair (V, E) of a finite set V of \fIvertices\fR\& and a finite set E of \fIdirected edges\fR\& (or just "edges")\&. The set of edges E is a subset of V x V (the Cartesian product of V with itself)\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Digraphs can be annotated with more information\&. Such information can be attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph\&. An annotated digraph is called a \fIlabeled digraph\fR\&, and the information attached to a vertex or an edge is called a \fIlabel\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
An edge e = (v, w) is said to \fIemanate\fR\& from vertex v and to be \fIincident\fR\& on vertex w\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
If an edge is emanating from v and incident on w, then w is said to be an \fIout-neighbor\fR\& of v, and v is said to be an \fIin-neighbor\fR\& of w\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIpath\fR\& P from v[1] to v[k] in a digraph (V, E) is a non-empty sequence v[1], v[2], \&.\&.\&., v[k] of vertices in V such that there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for 1 <= i < k\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
The \fIlength\fR\& of path P is k-1\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Path P is a \fIcycle\fR\& if the length of P is not zero and v[1] = v[k]\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIloop\fR\& is a cycle of length one\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
An \fIacyclic digraph\fR\& is a digraph without cycles\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIdepth-first traversal\fR\& of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process that visits all vertices of the digraph\&. Initially, all vertices are marked as unvisited\&. The traversal starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex\&. The search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex\&. At that point the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as there are unexamined edges\&. If unvisited vertices remain when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some so far unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is repeated\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIpartial ordering\fR\& of a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric, and reflexive relation between the objects of S\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
The problem of \fItopological sorting\fR\& is to find a total ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering\&. A digraph G = (V, E) is equivalent to a relation E on V (we neglect that the version of directed graphs provided by the \fIdigraph\fR\& module allows multiple edges between vertices)\&. If the digraph has no cycles of length two or more, the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a partial ordering\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIsubgraph\fR\& G\&' of G is a digraph whose vertices and edges form subsets of the vertices and edges of G\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
G\&' is \fImaximal\fR\& with respect to a property P if all other subgraphs that include the vertices of G\&' do not have property P\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIstrongly connected component\fR\& is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of vertices\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fIconnected component\fR\& is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of vertices, considering all edges undirected\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
An \fIarborescence\fR\& is an acyclic digraph with a vertex V, the \fIroot\fR\&, such that there is a unique path from V to every other vertex of G\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A \fItree\fR\& is an acyclic non-empty digraph such that there is a unique path between every pair of vertices, considering all edges undirected\&.

.LP
Creates a digraph where the vertices are the \fBstrongly connected components\fR\& of \fIDigraph\fR\& as returned by \fB\fIstrong_components/1\fR\&\fR\&\&. If X and Y are two different strongly connected components, and vertices x and y exist in X and Y, respectively, such that there is an edge \fBemanating\fR\& from x and \fBincident\fR\& on y, then an edge emanating from X and incident on Y is created\&.
.LP
The created digraph has the same type as \fIDigraph\fR\&\&. All vertices and edges have the default \fBlabel\fR\& \fI[]\fR\&\&.
.LP
Each \fBcycle\fR\& is included in some strongly connected component, which implies that a \fBtopological ordering\fR\& of the created digraph always exists\&.
