.SH NAME
erl_driver \- API functions for an Erlang driver.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
An Erlang driver is a library containing a set of native driver callback functions that the Erlang Virtual Machine calls when certain events occur\&. There can be multiple instances of a driver, each instance is associated with an Erlang port\&.

.RE
\fIUse this functionality with extreme care\&.\fR\&
.LP
A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the native code of the VM\&. Execution is not made in a safe environment\&. The VM \fIcannot\fR\& provide the same services as provided when executing Erlang code, such as pre-emptive scheduling or memory protection\&. If the driver callback function does not behave well, the whole VM will misbehave\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
An erroneously implemented driver callback can cause a VM internal state inconsistency, which can cause a crash of the VM, or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the call to the driver callback\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A driver callback doing \fBlengthy work\fR\& before returning degrades responsiveness of the VM and can cause miscellaneous strange behaviors\&. Such strange behaviors include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage and bad load balancing between schedulers\&. Strange behaviors that can occur because of lengthy work can also vary between Erlang/OTP releases\&.

.LP
As from ERTS 5\&.5\&.3 the driver interface has been extended (see \fB\fIextended marker\fR\&\fR\&)\&. The extended interface introduces \fBversion management\fR\&, the possibility to pass capability flags (see \fB\fIdriver_flags\fR\&\fR\&) to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
As from ERTS 5\&.9 old drivers must be recompiled and use the extended interface\&. They must also be adjusted to the \fB 64-bit capable driver interface\fR\&\&.

.LP
The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API functions declared in \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\&\&. They are used for outputting data from the driver, using timers, and so on\&.
.LP
Each driver instance is associated with a port\&. Every port has a port owner process\&. Communication with the port is normally done through the port owner process\&. Most of the functions take the \fIport\fR\& handle as an argument\&. This identifies the driver instance\&. Notice that this port handle must be stored by the driver, it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see \fB\fIdriver_entry\fR\&\fR\&)\&.
.LP
Some of the functions take a parameter of type \fIErlDrvBinary\fR\&, a driver binary\&. It is to be both allocated and freed by the caller\&. Using a binary directly avoids one extra copying of data\&.
.LP
Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with \fIhbuf\fR\& and \fIhlen\fR\& parameters\&. This buffer is sent as a list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is sent\&. This is convenient when matching on messages received from the port\&. (Although in the latest Erlang versions there is the binary syntax, which enables you to match on the beginning of a binary\&.)
.LP
In the runtime system with SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level or port level (driver instance level)\&. By default driver level locking will be used, that is, only one emulator thread will execute code in the driver at a time\&. If port level locking is used, multiple emulator threads can execute code in the driver at the same time\&. Only one thread at a time will call driver callbacks corresponding to the same port, though\&. To enable port level locking, set the \fIERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING\fR\& \fBdriver flag\fR\& in the \fB\fIdriver_entry\fR\&\fR\& used by the driver\&. When port level locking is used, the driver writer is responsible for synchronizing all accesses to data shared by the ports (driver instances)\&.
.LP
Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP support existed can run in the runtime system with SMP support, without being rewritten, if driver level locking is used\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers\&. If drivers access each other, they must provide their own mechanism for thread-safe synchronization\&. Such "inter-driver communication" is strongly discouraged\&.

.LP
Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support, specific driver callbacks were always called from the same thread\&. This is \fInot\fR\& the case in the runtime system with SMP support\&. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver callbacks can be made from different threads\&. For example, two consecutive calls to exactly the same callback for exactly the same port can be made from two different threads\&. This is for \fImost\fR\& drivers not a problem, but it can be\&. Drivers that depend on all callbacks that are called in the same thread, \fImust\fR\& be rewritten before they are used in the runtime system with SMP support\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver callbacks can be made from different threads\&.

.LP
Most functions in this API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe, that is, they \fIcannot\fR\& be called from arbitrary threads\&. Functions that are not documented as thread-safe can only be called from driver callbacks or function calls descending from a driver callback call\&. Notice that driver callbacks can be called from different threads\&. This, however, is not a problem for any function in this API, as the emulator has control over these threads\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Warning:
.RE
Functions not explicitly documented as thread-safe are \fInot\fR\& thread safe\&. Also notice that some functions are \fIonly\fR\& thread-safe when used in a runtime system with SMP support\&.
.LP
A function not explicitly documented as thread-safe can, at some point in time, have a thread-safe implementation in the runtime system\&. Such an implementation can however change to a thread \fIunsafe\fR\& implementation at any time \fIwithout any notice\fR\&\&.
.LP
\fIOnly use functions explicitly documented as thread-safe from arbitrary threads\&.\fR\&

.LP
As mentioned in the \fBwarning\fR\& text at the beginning of this section, it is of vital importance that a driver callback returns relatively fast\&. It is difficult to give an exact maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but usually a well-behaving driver callback is to return within 1 millisecond\&. This can be achieved using different approaches\&. If you have full control over the code to execute in the driver callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of work, and trigger multiple calls to the \fBtime-out callback\fR\& using zero time-outs\&. Function \fB\fIerl_drv_consume_timeslice\fR\&\fR\& can be useful to determine when to trigger such time-out callback calls\&. However, sometimes it cannot be implemented this way, for example when calling third-party libraries\&. In this case, you typically want to dispatch the work to another thread\&. Information about thread primitives is provided below\&.
.SH "FUNCTIONALITY"

.LP
All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are performed through driver API functions\&. Functions exist for the following functionality:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
Timer functions:
Control the timer that a driver can use\&. The timer has the emulator call the \fB\fItimeout\fR\&\fR\& entry function after a specified time\&. Only one timer is available for each driver instance\&.
.TP 2
.B
Queue handling:
Every driver instance has an associated queue\&. This queue is a \fISysIOVec\fR\&, which works as a buffer\&. It is mostly used for the driver to buffer data that is to be written to a device, it is a byte stream\&. If the port owner process closes the driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver is not closed\&. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before closing\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The queue can be manipulated from any threads if a port data lock is used\&. For more information, see \fB\fIErlDrvPDL\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Output functions:
With these functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator\&. The data is received as messages by the port owner process, see \fB\fIerlang:open_port/2\fR\&\fR\&\&. The vector function and the function taking a driver binary are faster, as they avoid copying the data buffer\&. There is also a fast way of sending terms from the driver, without going through the binary term format\&.
.TP 2
.B
Failure:
The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang\&. This is only for severe errors, when the driver cannot possibly keep open\&.
.TP 2
.B
Asynchronous calls:
Erlang/OTP R7B and later versions have provision for asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by Erlang\&. There is also a select call, which can be used for asynchronous drivers\&.
.TP 2
.B
Multi-threading:
A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided\&. The Erlang driver thread API only provides a subset of the functionality provided by the POSIX thread API\&. The subset provided is more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded programming:

The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread API on Windows\&. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of being portable, but there can exist situations where you want to use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows native thread API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is reasonable to recover from an error condition\&. If it is not reasonable to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is terminated\&. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the whole runtime system is terminated\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Notice that there is no "condition variable wait with time-out" in the Erlang driver thread API\&. This because of issues with \fIpthread_cond_timedwait\fR\&\&. When the system clock suddenly is changed, it is not always guaranteed that you will wake up from the call as expected\&. An Erlang runtime system must be able to cope with sudden changes of the system clock\&. Therefore, we have omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API\&. In the Erlang driver case, time-outs can and are to be handled with the timer functionality of the Erlang driver API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread support must be enabled in the runtime system\&. An Erlang driver can check if thread support is enabled by use of \fB\fIdriver_system_info\fR\&\fR\&\&. Notice that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this information can be retrieved through \fB\fIdriver_system_info\fR\&\fR\&\&. Also notice that many functions in the Erlang driver API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe, regardless of whether SMP support is enabled or not\&. If a function is not documented as thread-safe, it is \fInot\fR\& thread-safe\&.
.RE
.LP

Note:
.RE
When executing in an emulator thread, it is \fIvery important\fR\& that you unlock \fIall\fR\& locks you have locked before letting the thread out of your control; otherwise you are \fIvery likely\fR\& to deadlock the whole emulator\&.
.LP
If you need to use thread-specific data in an emulator thread, only have the thread-specific data set while the thread is under your control, and clear the thread-specific data before you let the thread out of your control\&.

.RS 2
.LP
In the future, debug functionality will probably be integrated with the Erlang driver thread API\&. All functions that create entities take a \fIname\fR\& argument\&. Currently the \fIname\fR\& argument is unused, but it will be used when the debug functionality is implemented\&. If you name all entities created well, the debug functionality will be able to give you better error reports\&.

Adding/removing drivers:
A driver can add and later remove drivers\&.
.TP 2

Monitoring processes:
A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port\&.

Version management:
Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the \fB\fIextended_marker\fR\&\fR\& field of their \fB\fIdriver_entry\fR\&\fR\& to \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&\&. \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\& defines:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\&, which is incremented when driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime system\&. Normally it suffices to recompile drivers when \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\& has changed, but it can, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers must be slightly modified\&. If so, this will of course be documented\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION\fR\&, which is incremented when new features are added\&. The runtime system uses the minor version of the driver to determine what features to use\&.
.LP
.RE

.RS 2
.LP
The runtime system normally refuses to load a driver if the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used by the runtime system\&. Old drivers with lower major versions are however allowed after a bump of the major version during a transition period of two major releases\&. Such old drivers can, however, fail if deprecated features are used\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The emulator refuses to load a driver that does not use the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers, as incompatible type changes for the callbacks \fB\fIoutput\fR\&\fR\&, \fB\fIcontrol\fR\&\fR\&, and \fB\fIcall\fR\&\fR\& were introduced in Erlang/OTP R15B\&. A driver written with the old types would compile with warnings and when called return garbage sizes to the emulator, causing it to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Therefore it is not enough to only recompile drivers written with version management for pre R15B types; the types must be changed in the driver suggesting other rewrites, especially regarding size variables\&. \fIInvestigate all warnings when recompiling\&.\fR\&
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Also, the API driver functions \fIdriver_output*\fR\& and \fIdriver_vec_to_buf\fR\&, \fIdriver_alloc/realloc*\fR\&, and the \fIdriver_*\fR\& queue functions were changed to have larger length arguments and return values\&. This is a lesser problem, as code that passes smaller types gets them auto-converted in the calls, and as long as the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an \fIint\fR\&, all will work as before\&.

.SH "REWRITES FOR 64-BIT DRIVER INTERFACE"

.LP
ERTS 5\&.9 introduced two new integer types, \fB\fIErlDrvSizeT\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIErlDrvSSizeT\fR\&\fR\&, which can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary\&.
.LP
To not update a driver and only recompile, it probably works when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security\&. Hopefully that will generate many important warnings\&. But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine, there \fIwill\fR\& be warnings and almost certainly crashes\&. So it is a \fIbad\fR\& idea to postpone updating the driver and not fixing the warnings\&.
.LP
When recompiling with \fIgcc\fR\&, use flag \fI-Wstrict-prototypes\fR\& to get better warnings\&. Try to find a similar flag if you use another compiler\&.

These changes are essential not to crash the emulator or worse cause malfunction\&.

Sane compiler\&'s calling conventions probably make these changes necessary only for a driver to handle data chunks that require 64-bit size fields (mostly larger than 2 GB, as that is what an \fIint\fR\& of 32 bits can hold)\&.

Sets and unsets the busy state of the port\&. If \fIon\fR\& is non-zero, the port is set to busy\&. If it is zero, the port is set to not busy\&. You typically want to combine this feature with the \fB busy port message queue\fR\& functionality\&.

Processes sending command data to the port are suspended if either the port or the port message queue is busy\&.
