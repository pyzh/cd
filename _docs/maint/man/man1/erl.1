.SH NAME
erl \- The Erlang emulator.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIerl\fR\& program starts an Erlang runtime system\&. The exact details (for example, whether \fIerl\fR\& is a script or a program and which other programs it calls) are system-dependent\&.
.LP
Windows users probably want to use the \fIwerl\fR\& program instead, which runs in its own window with scrollbars and supports command-line editing\&. The \fIerl\fR\& program on Windows provides no line editing in its shell, and on Windows 95 there is no way to scroll back to text that has scrolled off the screen\&. The \fIerl\fR\& program must be used, however, in pipelines or if you want to redirect standard input or output\&.

.RE
As from ERTS 5\&.9 (Erlang/OTP R15B) the runtime system does by default \fInot\fR\& bind schedulers to logical processors\&. For more information, see system flag \fB\fI+sbt\fR\&\fR\&\&.

Starts an Erlang runtime system\&.
.LP
The arguments can be divided into \fIemulator flags\fR\&, \fIflags\fR\&, and \fIplain arguments\fR\&:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Any argument starting with character \fI+\fR\& is interpreted as an \fBemulator flag\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
As indicated by the name, emulator flags control the behavior of the emulator\&.
.RE
.LP
.TP 2
*
Any argument starting with character \fI-\fR\& (hyphen) is interpreted as a \fBflag\fR\&, which is to be passed to the Erlang part of the runtime system, more specifically to the \fIinit\fR\& system process, see \fB\fIinit(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The \fIinit\fR\& process itself interprets some of these flags, the \fIinit flags\fR\&\&. It also stores any remaining flags, the \fIuser flags\fR\&\&. The latter can be retrieved by calling \fIinit:get_argument/1\fR\&\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
A small number of "-" flags exist, which now actually are emulator flags, see the description below\&.
.RE
.LP
.TP 2
*
Plain arguments are not interpreted in any way\&. They are also stored by the \fIinit\fR\& process and can be retrieved by calling \fIinit:get_plain_arguments/0\fR\&\&. Plain arguments can occur before the first flag, or after a \fI--\fR\& flag\&. Also, the \fI-extra\fR\& flag causes everything that follows to become plain arguments\&.

Here \fI+W w\fR\& and \fI+R 9\fR\& are emulator flags\&. \fI-s my_init\fR\& is an init flag, interpreted by \fIinit\fR\&\&. \fI-sname arnie\fR\& is a user flag, stored by \fIinit\fR\&\&. It is read by Kernel and causes the Erlang runtime system to become distributed\&. Finally, everything after \fI-extra\fR\& (that is, \fI+bertie\fR\&) is considered as plain arguments\&.

.SH "FLAGS"

.LP
In the following list, init flags are marked "(init flag)"\&. Unless otherwise specified, all other flags are user flags, for which the values can be retrieved by calling \fIinit:get_argument/1\fR\&\&. Notice that the list of user flags is not exhaustive, there can be more application-specific flags that instead are described in the corresponding application documentation\&.

\fI--\fR\& (init flag):
Everything following \fI--\fR\& up to the next flag (\fI-flag\fR\& or \fI+flag\fR\&) is considered plain arguments and can be retrieved using \fIinit:get_plain_arguments/0\fR\&\&.
.TP 2

\fI-Application Par Val\fR\&:
Sets the application configuration parameter \fIPar\fR\& to the value \fIVal\fR\& for the application \fIApplication\fR\&; see \fB\fIapp(4)\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIapplication(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&.

\fI-args_file FileName\fR\&:
Command-line arguments are read from the file \fIFileName\fR\&\&. The arguments read from the file replace flag \&'\fI-args_file FileName\fR\&\&' on the resulting command line\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The file \fIFileName\fR\& is to be a plain text file and can contain comments and command-line arguments\&. A comment begins with a \fI#\fR\& character and continues until the next end of line character\&. Backslash (\\\\) is used as quoting character\&. All command-line arguments accepted by \fIerl\fR\& are allowed, also flag \fI-args_file FileName\fR\&\&. Be careful not to cause circular dependencies between files containing flag \fI-args_file\fR\&, though\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The flag \fI-extra\fR\& is treated in special way\&. Its scope ends at the end of the file\&. Arguments following an \fI-extra\fR\& flag are moved on the command line into the \fI-extra\fR\& section, that is, the end of the command line following after an \fI-extra\fR\& flag\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fI-async_shell_start\fR\&:
The initial Erlang shell does not read user input until the system boot procedure has been completed (Erlang/OTP 5\&.4 and later)\&. This flag disables the start synchronization feature and lets the shell start in parallel with the rest of the system\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-boot File\fR\&:
Specifies the name of the boot file, \fIFile\&.boot\fR\&, which is used to start the system; see \fB\fIinit(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&. Unless \fIFile\fR\& contains an absolute path, the system searches for \fIFile\&.boot\fR\& in the current and \fI$ROOT/bin\fR\& directories\&.

\fI-config Config\fR\&:
Specifies the name of a configuration file, \fIConfig\&.config\fR\&, which is used to configure applications; see \fB\fIapp(4)\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIapplication(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.TP 2

\fI-connect_all false\fR\&:
If this flag is present, \fIglobal\fR\& does not maintain a fully connected network of distributed Erlang nodes, and then global name registration cannot be used; see \fB\fIglobal(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.TP 2

\fI-cookie Cookie\fR\&:
Obsolete flag without any effect and common misspelling for \fI-setcookie\fR\&\&. Use \fI-setcookie\fR\& instead\&.
.TP 2

\fI-emu_args\fR\&:
Useful for debugging\&. Prints the arguments sent to the emulator\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-emu_type Type\fR\&:
Start an emulator of a different type\&. For example, to start the lock-counter emualator, use \fI-emu_type lcnt\fR\&\&. (The emulator must already be built\&. Use the \fIconfigure\fR\& option \fI--enable-lock-counter\fR\& to build the lock-counter emulator\&.)
.TP 2

\fI-hidden\fR\&:
Starts the Erlang runtime system as a hidden node, if it is run as a distributed node\&. Hidden nodes always establish hidden connections to all other nodes except for nodes in the same global group\&. Hidden connections are not published on any of the connected nodes, that is, none of the connected nodes are part of the result from \fInodes/0\fR\& on the other node\&. See also hidden global groups; \fB\fIglobal_group(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-hosts Hosts\fR\&:
Specifies the IP addresses for the hosts on which Erlang boot servers are running, see \fB\fIerl_boot_server(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&. This flag is mandatory if flag \fI-loader inet\fR\& is present\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The IP addresses must be specified in the standard form (four decimal numbers separated by periods, for example, \fI"150\&.236\&.20\&.74"\fR\&\&. Hosts names are not acceptable, but a broadcast address (preferably limited to the local network) is\&.

\fI-instr\fR\& (emulator flag):
Selects an instrumented Erlang runtime system (virtual machine) to run, instead of the ordinary one\&. When running an instrumented runtime system, some resource usage data can be obtained and analyzed using the \fIinstrument\fR\& module\&. Functionally, it behaves exactly like an ordinary Erlang runtime system\&.

\fI-mode interactive | embedded\fR\&:
Modules are auto loaded when they are first referenced if the runtime system runs in \fIinteractive\fR\& mode, which is the default\&. In \fIembedded\fR\& mode modules are not auto loaded\&. The latter is recommended when the boot script preloads all modules, as conventionally happens in OTP releases\&. See \fB\fIcode(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fI-name Name\fR\&:
Makes the Erlang runtime system into a distributed node\&. This flag invokes all network servers necessary for a node to become distributed; see \fB\fInet_kernel(3)\fR\&\fR\&\&. It is also ensured that \fIepmd\fR\& runs on the current host before Erlang is started; see \fB\fIepmd(1)\fR\&\fR\&\&.and the \fB\fI-start_epmd\fR\&\fR\& option\&.

\fI+sub true|false\fR\&:

By default scheduler utilization balancing is disabled and instead scheduler compaction of load is enabled, which strives for a load distribution that causes as many scheduler threads as possible to be fully loaded (that is, not run out of work)\&.
