erl_ddll \- Dynamic driver loader and linker.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides an interface for loading and unloading \fIErlang linked-in drivers\fR\& in runtime\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
This is a large reference document\&. For casual use of this module, and for most real world applications, the descriptions of functions \fB\fIload/2\fR\&\fR\& and \fB\fIunload/1\fR\&\fR\& are enough to getting started\&.

.LP
The driver is to be provided as a dynamically linked library in an object code format specific for the platform in use, that is, \fI\&.so\fR\& files on most Unix systems and \fI\&.ddl\fR\& files on Windows\&. An Erlang linked-in driver must provide specific interfaces to the emulator, so this module is not designed for loading arbitrary dynamic libraries\&. For more information about Erlang drivers, see \fB\fIerts:erl_driver\fR\&\fR\& \&.
.LP
When describing a set of functions (that is, a module, a part of a module, or an application), executing in a process and wanting to use a ddll-driver, we use the term \fIuser\fR\&\&. A process can have many users (different modules needing the same driver) and many processes running the same code, making up many \fIusers\fR\& of a driver\&.
.LP
In the basic scenario, each user loads the driver before starting to use it and unloads the driver when done\&. The reference counting keeps track of processes and the number of loads by each process\&. This way the driver is only unloaded when no one wants it (it has no user)\&. The driver also keeps track of ports that are opened to it\&. This enables delay of unloading until all ports are closed, or killing of all ports that use the driver when it is unloaded\&.
.LP
The interface supports two basic scenarios of loading and unloading\&. Each scenario can also have the option of either killing ports when the driver is unloading, or waiting for the ports to close themselves\&. The scenarios are as follows:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fILoad and Unload on a "When Needed Basis"\fR\&:
This (most common) scenario simply supports that each \fBuser\fR\& of the driver loads it when needed and unloads it when no longer needed\&. The driver is always reference counted and as long as a process keeping the driver loaded is still alive, the driver is present in the system\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Each \fBuser\fR\& of the driver use \fIliterally\fR\& the same pathname for the driver when demanding load, but the \fBusers\fR\& are not concerned with if the driver is already loaded from the file system or if the object code must be loaded from file system\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The following two pairs of functions support this scenario:
.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIload/2 and unload/1\fR\&:
When using the \fIload/unload\fR\& interfaces, the driver is not unloaded until the \fIlast port\fR\& using the driver is closed\&. Function \fIunload/1\fR\& can return immediately, as the \fBusers\fR\& have no interrest in when the unloading occurs\&. The driver is unloaded when no one needs it any longer\&.
.RS 2
.LP
If a process having the driver loaded dies, it has the same effect as if unloading is done\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
When loading, function \fIload/2\fR\& returns \fIok\fR\& when any instance of the driver is present\&. Thus, if a driver is waiting to get unloaded (because of open ports), it simply changes state to no longer need unloading\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fIload_driver/2 and unload_driver/1\fR\&:
These interfaces are intended to be used when it is considered an error that ports are open to a driver that no \fBuser\fR\& has loaded\&. The ports that are still open when the last \fBuser\fR\& calls \fIunload_driver/1\fR\& or when the last process having the driver loaded dies, are killed with reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The function names \fIload_driver\fR\& and \fIunload_driver\fR\& are kept for backward compatibility\&.
.RE
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fILoading and Reloading for Code Replacement\fR\&:
This scenario can occur if the driver code needs replacement during operation of the Erlang emulator\&. Implementing driver code replacement is a little more tedious than Beam code replacement, as one driver cannot be loaded as both "old" and "new" code\&. All \fBusers\fR\& of a driver must have it closed (no open ports) before the old code can be unloaded and the new code can be loaded\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The unloading/loading is done as one atomic operation, blocking all processes in the system from using the driver in question while in progress\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The preferred way to do driver code replacement is to let \fIone single process\fR\& keep track of the driver\&. When the process starts, the driver is loaded\&. When replacement is required, the driver is reloaded\&. Unload is probably never done, or done when the process exits\&. If more than one \fBuser\fR\& has a driver loaded when code replacement is demanded, the replacement cannot occur until the last "other" \fBuser\fR\& has unloaded the driver\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Demanding reload when a reload is already in progress is always an error\&. Using the high-level functions, it is also an error to demand reloading when more than one \fBuser\fR\& has the driver loaded\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
To simplify driver replacement, avoid designing your system so that more than one \fBuser\fR\& has the driver loaded\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The two functions for reloading drivers are to be used together with corresponding load functions to support the two different behaviors concerning open ports:
.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIload/2 and reload/2\fR\&:
This pair of functions is used when reloading is to be done after the last open port to the driver is closed\&.
.RS 2
.LP
As \fIreload/2\fR\& waits for the reloading to occur, a misbehaving process keeping open ports to the driver (or keeping the driver loaded) can cause infinite waiting for reload\&. Time-outs must be provided outside of the process demanding the reload or by using the low-level interface \fB\fItry_load/3\fR\&\fR\& in combination with driver monitors\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fIload_driver/2 and reload_driver/2\fR\&:
This pair of functions are used when open ports to the driver are to be killed with reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& to allow for new driver code to get loaded\&.
.RS 2
.LP
However, if another process has the driver loaded, calling \fIreload_driver\fR\& returns error code \fIpending_process\fR\&\&. As stated earlier, the recommended design is to not allow other \fBusers\fR\& than the "driver reloader" to demand loading of the driver in question\&.

Loads and links the dynamic driver \fIName\fR\&\&. \fIPath\fR\& is a file path to the directory containing the driver\&. \fIName\fR\& must be a sharable object/dynamic library\&. Two drivers with different \fIPath\fR\& parameters cannot be loaded under the same name\&. \fIName\fR\& is a string or atom containing at least one character\&.
.LP
The \fIName\fR\& specified is to correspond to the filename of the dynamically loadable object file residing in the directory specified as \fIPath\fR\&, but \fIwithout\fR\& the extension (that is, \fI\&.so\fR\&)\&. The driver name provided in the driver initialization routine must correspond with the filename, in much the same way as Erlang module names correspond to the names of the \fI\&.beam\fR\& files\&.
.LP
If the driver was previously unloaded, but is still present because of open ports to it, a call to \fIload/2\fR\& stops the unloading and keeps the driver (as long as \fIPath\fR\& is the same), and \fIok\fR\& is returned\&. If you really want the object code to be reloaded, use \fB\fIreload/2\fR\&\fR\& or the low-level interface \fB\fItry_load/3\fR\&\fR\& instead\&. See also the description of \fB\fIdifferent scenarios\fR\&\fR\& for loading/unloading in the introduction\&.
.LP
If more than one process tries to load an already loaded driver with the same \fIPath\fR\&, or if the same process tries to load it many times, the function returns \fIok\fR\&\&. The emulator keeps track of the \fIload/2\fR\& calls, so that a corresponding number of \fIunload/2\fR\& calls must be done from the same process before the driver gets unloaded\&. It is therefore safe for an application to load a driver that is shared between processes or applications when needed\&. It can safely be unloaded without causing trouble for other parts of the system\&.
.LP
It is not allowed to load multiple drivers with the same name but with different \fIPath\fR\& parameters\&.

Note:
.RE
\fIPath\fR\& is interpreted literally, so that all loaders of the same driver must specify the same \fIliteral\fR\& \fIPath\fR\& string, although different paths can point out the same directory in the file system (because of use of relative paths and links)\&.

.LP
On success, the function returns \fIok\fR\&\&. On failure, the return value is \fI{error,ErrorDesc}\fR\&, where \fIErrorDesc\fR\& is an opaque term to be translated into human readable form by function \fB\fIformat_error/1\fR\&\fR\&\&.

Works essentially as \fIload/2\fR\&, but loads the driver with other options\&. All ports using the driver are killed with reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& when the driver is to be unloaded\&.

The number of loads and unloads by different \fBusers\fR\& influences the loading and unloading of a driver file\&. The port killing therefore only occurs when the \fIlast\fR\& \fBuser\fR\& unloads the driver, or when the last process having loaded the driver exits\&.

This interface (or at least the name of the functions) is kept for backward compatibility\&. Using \fB\fItry_load/3\fR\&\fR\& with \fI{driver_options,[kill_ports]}\fR\& in the option list gives the same effect regarding the port killing\&.

Creates a driver monitor and works in many ways as \fB\fIerlang:monitor/2\fR\&\fR\& in ERTS, does for processes\&. When a driver changes state, the monitor results in a monitor message that is sent to the calling process\&. \fIMonitorRef\fR\& returned by this function is included in the message sent\&.
.LP
As with process monitors, each driver monitor set only generates \fIone single message\fR\&\&. The monitor is "destroyed" after the message is sent, so it is then not needed to call \fB\fIdemonitor/1\fR\&\fR\&\&.

\fITag\fR\&:

\fIloaded\fR\&:
Notifies when the driver is reloaded (or loaded if loading is underway)\&. It only makes sense to monitor drivers that are in the process of being loaded or reloaded\&. A future driver name for loading cannot be monitored\&. That only results in a \fIDOWN\fR\& message sent immediately\&.

When the function returns \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\& or \fI{ok, pending_process}\fR\&, one can get information about when the driver is \fIactually\fR\& loaded by using option \fI{monitor, MonitorOption}\fR\&\&.

When monitoring is requested, and a corresponding \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\& or \fI{ok, pending_process}\fR\& would be returned, the function instead returns a tuple \fI{ok, PendingStatus, reference()}\fR\& and the process then gets a monitor message later, when the driver gets loaded\&.

In case of loading, monitoring can \fInot\fR\& only get triggered by using option \fI{reload, ReloadOption}\fR\&, but also in special cases where the load error is transient\&. Thus, \fI{monitor, pending_driver}\fR\& is to be used under basically \fIall\fR\& real world circumstances\&.

The function accepts the following parameters:

\fIPath\fR\&:
The file system path to the directory where the driver object file is located\&. The filename of the object file (minus extension) must correspond to the driver name (used in parameter \fIName\fR\&) and the driver must identify itself with the same name\&. \fIPath\fR\& can be provided as an \fIiolist()\fR\&, meaning it can be a list of other \fIiolist()\fR\&s, characters (8-bit integers), or binaries, all to be flattened into a sequence of characters\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The (possibly flattened) \fIPath\fR\& parameter must be consistent throughout the system\&. A driver is to, by all \fBusers\fR\&, be loaded using the same \fIliteral\fR\& \fIPath\fR\&\&. The exception is when \fIreloading\fR\& is requested, in which case \fIPath\fR\& can be specified differently\&. Notice that all \fBusers\fR\& trying to load the driver later need to use the \fInew\fR\& \fIPath\fR\& if \fIPath\fR\& is changed using a \fIreload\fR\& option\&. This is yet another reason to have \fIonly one loader\fR\& of a driver one wants to upgrade in a running system\&.

The name specified when loading is used to find the object file (with the help of \fIPath\fR\& and the system-implied extension suffix, that is, \fI\&.so\fR\&)\&.

The only allowed driver option is \fIkill_ports\fR\&, which means that all ports opened to the driver are killed with exit reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& when no process any longer has the driver loaded\&.

Option \fIpending_driver\fR\& is of little use, but is present for completeness, as it is well defined which reload options that can give rise to which delays\&. However, it can be a good idea to use the same \fIMonitorOption\fR\& as the \fIReloadOption\fR\&, if present\&.
.RE

If reloading is not requested, it can still be useful to specify option \fImonitor\fR\&, as forced unloads (driver option \fIkill_ports\fR\& or option \fIkill_ports\fR\& to \fB\fItry_unload/2\fR\&\fR\&) trigger a transient state where driver loading cannot be performed until all closing ports are closed\&. Thus, as \fItry_unload\fR\& can, in almost all situations, return \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\&, always specify at least \fI{monitor, pending_driver}\fR\& in production code (see the monitor discussion earlier)\&.

\fI{reload, ReloadOption}\fR\&:
This option is used to \fIreload\fR\& a driver from disk, most often in a code upgrade scenario\&. Having a \fIreload\fR\& option also implies that parameter \fIPath\fR\& does \fInot\fR\& need to be consistent with earlier loads of the driver\&.

.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2

\fIpending\fR\&:
With the atom \fIpending\fR\&, reloading is requested for any driver and is effectuated when \fIall\fR\& ports opened to the driver are closed\&. The driver replacement in this case takes place regardless if there are still pending \fBusers\fR\& having the driver loaded\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The option also triggers port-killing (if driver option \fIkill_ports\fR\& is used) although there are pending users, making it usable for forced driver replacement, but laying much responsibility on the driver \fBusers\fR\&\&.

This is the low-level function to unload (or decrement reference counts of) a driver\&. It can be used to force port killing, in much the same way as the driver option \fIkill_ports\fR\& implicitly does\&. Also, it can trigger a monitor either because other \fBusers\fR\& still have the driver loaded or because open ports use the driver\&.
.LP
Unloading can be described as the process of telling the emulator that this particular part of the code in this particular process (that is, this \fBuser\fR\&) no longer needs the driver\&. That can, if there are no other users, trigger unloading of the driver, in which case the driver name disappears from the system and (if possible) the memory occupied by the driver executable code is reclaimed\&.
.LP
If the driver has option \fIkill_ports\fR\& set, or if \fIkill_ports\fR\& is specified as an option to this function, all pending ports using this driver are killed when unloading is done by the last \fBuser\fR\&\&. If no port-killing is involved and there are open ports, the unloading is delayed until no more open ports use the driver\&. If, in this case, another \fBuser\fR\& (or even this user) loads the driver again before the driver is unloaded, the unloading never takes place\&.
.LP
To allow the \fBuser\fR\& to \fIrequest unloading\fR\& to wait for \fIactual unloading\fR\&, \fImonitor\fR\& triggers can be specified in much the same way as when loading\&. However, as \fBusers\fR\& of this function seldom are interested in more than decrementing the reference counts, monitoring is seldom needed\&.
